This repository contains all of the courses in' Theory of "Building and developing a Website" that I've learnt at PTIT-HCM.

After learning the theory on class, I have had an assignment "LAB" for each content to be more practical. 
Also, this repo contains all of my answers for these LABs.



The course started in January 2024 and finished in the middle of June 2024.
